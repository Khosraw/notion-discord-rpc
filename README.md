## Requirements
- macOS or Windows
- Python3

## Setup
- Clone this repository
- Ensure that Discord is open and you have logged in
- Ensure that Notion is open and you have the file of your choice open
- Run the python script by using this command `python3 script_macos.py` if on MacOS or `python3 script_windows.py` if on Windows
- Give the necessary permissions and re-run the script
- Your Discord activity should now be updated

## What This Script Can't Do
- Update the Notion page name if changed after running the script on MacOS. This feature is available on Windows but not on MacOS since I do not have a MacOS computer to test such a feature.
