# notion-discord-rpc

Discord Rich Presence (RPC) for [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

## Requirements
- macOS
- Python3

## Setup
- Clone this repository
- Ensure that Discord is open and you have logged in
- Ensure that Notion is open and you have the file of your choice open
- Run the python script by using this command `python3 script.py`
- Give the necessary permissions and re-run the script
- Your Discord activity should now be updated

## What This Script Can't Do
- Update the Notion page name if changed after running the script. Maybe in the future, eh?
- Run on platforms other than Windows. Why not? As of now, the script uses Applescript to check if Notion is open or not. Hence, it is not supported on other platforms
